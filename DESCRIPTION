Description: This package provides tools for predicting epigenetic age using
    ensemble methods. It includes multiple clock types including Universal Clocks,
    Elastic Epigenetic clocks, static ensemble methods, and dynamic ensemble clocks
    for accurate age prediction across various tissues and species. 
    CITATION: This package accompanies the open access publication by Haghani et al. (2025):
    "EnsembleAge: enhancing epigenetic age assessment with a multi-clock framework" 
    in GeroScience (DOI: 10.1007/s11357-025-01808-1). The clocks are freely
    available for research use.
